# This is roughly the shape of a binomial distribution, which is expected since each variant 
# is either from the lab strain or the wine strain, with a 50% chance to be either one 
# during sporulation. Therefore, for enough variants, the allele frequency should scatter
# around 0.5.

# It is a right skewed distribution with most read depths around 5, which is expected since
# Illumina sequencing is short read and therefore most reads have moderate coverage.
