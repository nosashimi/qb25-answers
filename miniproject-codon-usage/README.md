# My Project

To measure codon usage.

The result of running codon-usage.py on subset.fa looks like: 
NP_001077862.1 {"type": "CDS", "gene": "DDTL", "product": "D-dopachrome decarboxylase-like protein", "locus": ""}
ATG
CCG
TTC
CTG
GAG
CTG
...
The output looks correct because the first codon for each contig is ATG, the start codon.
