2.2.1 The slope is 0.37757, indicating that for each additional year the mother ages, the DNM increases by 0.37757.
2.2.2 This relationship is significant because of the 2.2e-16 p-value, which means the probability of this relationship happening by chance is 2.2e-16.

2.3.1 The slope is 1.35384, indicating that for each additional year the father ages, the DNM increases by 1.35384.
2.3.2 This relationship is significant because of the 2.2e-16 p-value, which means the probability of this relationship happening by chance is 2.2e-16.

2.4 f_DNM = 10.32632 + 1.35384 * f_age = 10.32632 + 1.35384 * 50.5 = 78.69524.

2.6.1 The average difference is 39.23485, meaning on average fathers contribute about 39 more DNM per proband than mothers, which aligns with the plot showing a higher distribution of DNM counts for fathers.
2.6.2 This relationship is significant given the 2.2e-16 p-value, which means the probability of this difference happening by chance is 2.2e-16.
2.6.3 The intercept is also 39.2348, which represents the mean difference between paternal and maternal DNM counts.

3.1 The History of Himalayan Mountaineering Expeditions https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/readme.md
3.2 The distribution of first recorded climbing attempt on the peak across years. The attempts peak in the 60s and around 2010.
3.3 Hypothesis: There is a linear relationship betweeen the number of first recorded attempts on peaks and years. The p-value is 0.2529, meaning this relationship is not statistically significant.
